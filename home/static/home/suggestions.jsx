        <p>My CS50 final project - a comprehensive Flask web application that revolutionizes student engagement by creating a transparent, democratic platform for submitting, reviewing, and tracking suggestions to the student council. This sophisticated system bridges the gap between students and administration through technology. ï¿½</p>
        <p>Built with Flask and featuring comprehensive user authentication, role-based access control, and a complete suggestion lifecycle management system. Students, parents, and teachers can submit suggestions and track their progress from submission through approval, implementation, and completion.</p>
        <p>This application demonstrates advanced web development concepts including database design, user authentication with Flask-Login, administrative controls, and responsive frontend design. The system handles everything from suggestion submission to meeting minutes management.</p>
        <p><strong>Comprehensive technology stack and features:</strong></p>
        <ul className="tech-list">
            <li>Flask framework with Blueprint architecture and session management</li>
            <li>SQLite database with complex relational schema (5 interconnected tables)</li>
            <li>Flask-Login for secure user authentication and role-based access control</li>
            <li>Werkzeug for password hashing and security implementations</li>
            <li>Bootstrap 4/5 for responsive, mobile-friendly interface design</li>
            <li>Dynamic template system with Jinja2 for efficient content rendering</li>
            <li>Administrative functions including account management and meeting minutes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Features include public suggestion viewing, admin approval workflows, progress tracking with delay management, completion tracking, and comprehensive meeting minutes management - all within a secure, user-friendly interface.</p>
